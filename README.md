Website building with Keyln

Building a little game website with Keyln. He seems to enjoy programming and this is something special we can do together. I may be doing the majority of the coding at this point, but eventually when he is ready, I hope he can really join in the coding. For now he comes up with ideas and searches for images to use and may even make a few icons or images to use in this game. So far we are both having a lot of fun doing this!

Putting the website on github so that he can check it out at any time and even have the chance to show off his game to anyone he wants to
